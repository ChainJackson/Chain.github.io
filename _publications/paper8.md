## Abstract
This article studies the indentation response of a layered cylinder by establishing a three-dimensional (3D) symplectic framework for contact analysis. The Hamiltonian transformation of 3D layered structures for different scenarios has been developed and proven. The Saint-Venant solutions are obtained through a semi-inverse method, and the eigen-solutions for general eigenvalues are constructed in the Papkovich-Neuber form. These general eigen-solutions can also be derived via a sub-symplectic structure representation, which makes the model to be applicable to the cases with multi-field couplings. A strategy for determining the contact region is proposed by mapping the symplectic expansion into a specialized form via the Cantor pairing diagram. The analytical solutions are validated through comparison with finite element. The theoretical formulation and modeling offer an effective guidance for material characterizations of the cylinder.
