## Abstract
Material characterization using high-throughput testing (HTT) techniques have shown great 
promise in expediting the advancement of high-performance materials. A key step in HTT is 
the adoption of functionally graded specimen, whose material inhomogeneity however imposes 
a great challenge on analytically evaluating its responsive behavior under external loads. This 
work establishes the first symplectic framework for contact analysis of a finite-sized magneto
electro-elastic plane with an exponential material gradient along the horizontal direction. The 
governing equations are first represented in matrix form in a state space, with the full state 
vector defined and the operator matrix derived. The operator matrix is found to be distinct 
from the Hamiltonian operator matrix in the case of a homogeneous medium. With all the eigen
solutions obtained, the Hamiltonian mixed energy variational principle is then introduced to 
derive the coefficients in the symplectic expansion. The developed analytical solution not only 
exhibits asymmetry properties, but also converges rapidly. The analytical results are validated 
through comparison with the finite element simulations. The analytical platform established 
here would work as an effective theoretical basis for subsequent development of quantitative 
HTT techniques.
