## Abstract
**Background** Schizophrenia (SCZ) shares high clinical relevance with the immune system, and the potential 
interactions of psychopharmacological drugs with the immune system are still an overlooked area. Here, we aimed to 
identify whether the second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) monotherapy or combined therapy of SGA with other 
psychiatric medications influence the routine blood immunity biomarkers of patients with SCZ. \n
**Methods** Medical records of inpatients with SCZ from January 2019 to June 2023 were retrospectively screened 
from June 2023 to August 2023. The demographic data and peripheral levels of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, 
INF-γ, and IL-17 A), lymphocyte subtype proportions (CD3+, CD4+, CD8 + T-cell, and natural killer (NK) cells), and 
thyroid autoimmune antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and antithyroglobulin antibody (TGAb)) were 
collected and analyzed. \n
**Results** 30 drug-naïve patients, 64 SGA monotherapy (20 for first-episode SCZ, 44 for recurrent SCZ) for at least one 
week, 39 combined therapies for recurrent SCZ (18 with antidepressant, 10 with benzodiazepine, and 11 with mood 
stabilizer) for at least two weeks, and 23 used to receive SGA monotherapy (had withdrawn for at least two weeks) 
were included despite specific medication. No difference in cytokines was found between the SGA monotherapy 
sub-groups (p > 0.05). Of note, SGA monotherapy appeared to induce a down-regulation of IFN-γ in both first (mean 
[95% confidence interval]: 1.08 [0.14–2.01] vs. 4.60 [2.11–7.08], p = 0.020) and recurrent (1.88 [0.71–3.05] vs. 4.60 
[2.11–7.08], p = 0.027) episodes compared to drug-naïve patients. However, the lymphocyte proportions and thyroid 
autoimmune antibodies remained unchanged after at least two weeks of SGA monotherapy (p > 0.05). In combined 
therapy groups, results mainly resembled the SGA monotherapy for recurrent SCZ (p > 0.05). \n
**Conclusion** The study demonstrated that SGA monotherapy possibly achieved its comfort role via modulating IFN-γ, 
and SGA combined therapy showed an overall resemblance to monotherapy.
