## Abstract
This work formulates a symplectic framework for contact analysis of a horizontally laminated, magneto-electro-elastic, finite specimen. By incorporating dual variables and deriving the Hamiltonian operator matrix within the symplectic space, the constraints on the state variables are fulfilled through the property of symplectic orthogonality. The state variables between different layers are connected via the transfer matrices, and the Hamiltonian mixed energy variational principle is generalized for the laminated medium. Distinct from traditional methods, the symplectic framework offers a more realistic and efficient analysis approach for a finite-sized specimen, applicable to indenters with arbitrary profiles but predetermined contact region. The interfacial and boundary effects are explored, with remarkably accurate results as compared to the finite element simulations. This research not only enhances our understanding of the underlying phenomena but also lays a foundation for materials characterization using high-throughput testing techniques.
