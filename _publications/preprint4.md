## Abstract
Crack problems may be considered as the inverse of contact problems 1. Conventional contact analysis frameworks, however, are predominantly established for infinite domains and concentrate on crack tip characteristics formulated in polar coordinates. The critical aspects of finite domain sizes and boundary effect have been neglected. This report extends previous work on contact analysis[CC25, CC24, CCL25], establishing a symplectic framework for fracture mechanics in both simply and multiply connected domains within a Cartesian coordinate system. Based on the dual Hamiltonian transformation[CLC25], the symplectic fracture analysis of inhomogeneous media is carried out. The stress intensity factor K I and J-integral are also discussed. Key equations from the report are listed below.
