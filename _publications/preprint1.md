## Abstract
Basic formulations in the Nambu-Routh mechanics are presented. The generalized Legendre transformation are proposed to formulate Nambu-Routh functions. Exterior differential forms are involved to enhance the convenience of derivation process.

## Keywords
Nambu-Routh mechanics; generalized Legendre transformation
