## Abstract
High-throughput characterization (HTC) techniques grounded in contact mechanics have significantly propelled advancements in materials science by enabling quantitative assessments of material properties efficiently and precisely. Tailored for HTC of whole-field material properties, an effective Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer neural operator (KATNO) architecture is established to conduct the inverse contact analysis, where the datasets are prepared through finite element analysis of isotropic inhomogeneous cubes as well as symplectic analysis of layered cylinders. The normalized cross-attention and self-attention modules are designed to evaluate queries, keys, and values within the Transformer framework. Additionally, a gating network is employed to average the weights of multiple expert group-rational Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (GR-KANs). In representative numerical examples, predicted results and ground truth exhibit high consistency. Various KATNO architectures are explored to identify essential design criteria according to the mean L2 relative error. The limitations of neural operators based on contact analysis are highlighted, offering insights for future advancements in HTC techniques.
