## Abstract
High-throughput characterization (HTC) is a highly time-efficient and space- compact method for material testing.  It enables acquisition of comprehensive material properties in a single experiment.  Among those testing techniques, indentation-based material characterization is of significant importance.  Given the mappings of modulus distribution on indentation responses derived by symplectic contact analysis as well as finite element simulations, a physics-informed U-net enhanced Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold neural operator (PIU-FKANO) is established as a surrogate model to carry out the inverse contact analysis.  Displacement and curve measurement techniques are applied to facilitate integration of the neural operator with experiments.  Predicted and true modulus fields demonstrate a high consistency in four representative numerical examples.  Different architectures of PIU-FKANO are analyzed to explore a model that excels in terms of the relative L2 error.  Furthermore, the proposed model also shows more stable performance as compared with the other models, thus offering robust support for the HTC techniques.
