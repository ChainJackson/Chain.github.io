## Abstract
A symplectic framework for a compressible graded soft electroactive material of finite size is established in this paper for contact analysis.  With nonlinear theory of electroelasticity and incremental field theory, linearized incremental equations are derived and transformed into the symplectic form.  Dual-shifted Hamiltonian transformation of a quasi-Hamiltonian operator is obtained in a general case.  Eigen-solutions of special and general eigenvalues are also analytical constructed for a degenerated model.  Hamiltonian mixed energy variational principle is introduced to determine the coefficients appeared in the symplectic expansion.  Variables in the incremental field are obtained and displayed, which may pave the way of subsequent researches on inhomogeneous contact analyses.
