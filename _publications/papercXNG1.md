Background and aim
Immunity alterations have been observed in bipolar disorder (BD). However, whether serum positivity of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii), rubella, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) shared clinical relevance with BD, remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate this association.
Methods
Antibody seropositivity of T gondii, rubella virus, CMV IgM, and IgG of females with BD and controls was extracted based on medical records (from January 2018 to January 2023). Family history, type of BD, onset age, and psychotic symptom history were also collected.
Results
585 individuals with BD and 800 healthy controls were involved. Individuals with BD revealed a lower positive rate of T gondii IgG in the 10–20 aged group (OR = 0.10), and a higher positive rate of rubella IgG in the 10–20 (OR = 5.44) and 20–30 aged group (OR = 3.15). BD with family history preferred a higher positive …
