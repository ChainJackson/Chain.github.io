## Abstract
**Background and aim**: Immunity alterations have been observed in bipolar disorder (BD). However, whether serum 
positivity of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii), rubella, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) shared clinical 
relevance with BD, remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate this association. 
Methods: Antibody seropositivity of IgM and IgG to T gondii, rubella virus, and CMV of females with BD and 
controls was extracted based on medical records from January 2018 to January 2023. Family history, type of BD, 
onset age, and psychotic symptom history were also collected. <br>
**Results**: 585 individuals with BD and 800 healthy controls were involved. Individuals with BD revealed a lower 
positive rate of T gondii IgG in the 10–20 aged group (OR =0.10), and a higher positive rate of rubella IgG in the 
10–20 (OR =5.44) and 20–30 aged group (OR =3.15). BD with family history preferred a higher positive rate of 
T gondii IgG (OR =24.00). Type-I BD owned a decreased positive rate of rubella IgG (OR =0.37) and an elevated 
positive rate of CMV IgG (OR =2.12) compared to type-II BD, while BD with early onset showed contrast results 
compared to BD without early onset (Rubella IgG, OR =2.54; CMV IgG, OR =0.26). BD with psychotic symptom 
history displayed a lower positive rate of rubella IgG (OR =0.50). <br>
**Limitations**: Absence of male evidence and control of socioeconomic status and environmental exposure. <br> 
**Conclusions**: Differential antibody seropositive rates of T gondii, rubella, and cytomegalovirus in BD were 
observed.
