## Abstract
High-throughput testing technologies based on functionally graded specimens hold significant promise for accelerating the development of novel materials. Nevertheless, the inherent material inhomogeneity and multi-field coupling pose great obstacles for contact analysis of functionally graded specimens of advanced fuctional materials. Almost all the pervious contact analyses primarily concentrate on a vertically graded half-plane or half-space [1], with limited exploration into a horizontally or bi-directionally graded material of finite-sized domain. This work establishes a novel symplectic framework for contact analysis of a finite-sized magneto-electro-elastic plane with a bi-directionally exponential material gradient. State equations are constructed in the matrix form, leading to a dual-shift Hamiltonian transformation under homogeneous displacement constraint at the boundary. The dual-shift adjoint symplectic orthogonality is introduced, elucidating the implications of symmetry breaking. Eigen-solutions of special and general eigenvalues are derived to constitute the complete solution in the symplectic expansion. Oscillations as well as the Gibbs phenomenon are elucidated in this study, both rooted in the fact that the symplectic analysis is based on the method of separation of variables [2,3]. It is noted that the finite nature of the model is suitable for analyzing the boundary effects. This approach allows analytical and numerical solutions in the whole domain and shows a high accuracy in comparison with the commercial finite element software. Furthermore, an algorithm suitable for determining the contact area of various indenters with smooth shape function is also proposed. In addition, the analytical result serves as a fundamental solution for the boundary element method, which paves the way for the subsequent study of inverse problems.
